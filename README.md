# Dog-Breed-Classifier

Project Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, you will find how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I made important design decisions about the user experience for the app.
